But as for big companies, it becomes crucial for them to obtain the trends of the company for any changes need to be made. Hence we introduce Big Data Analysis to solve this problem.

It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Long Short Term Memories(LSTMs) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDS's (intrusion detection systems). LSTMs can also be efficiently applied for time-series predictions. In this project, its shows a four stacked LSTM network for early prediction  new Coronavirus dissease infections in some of the mentioned  affected countries (India, USA, Czech Republic and Russia) , which is based on real world data sets which are analyzed using various perspectives like day-wise number of confirmed cases, number of Cured cases, death cases.

6604,natural-language-processing,Speech_Signal_Processing_and_Classification,gionanide,"Front-end speech processing aims at extracting proper features from short- term segments of a speech utterance, known as frames. It is a pre-requisite step toward any pattern recognition problem employing speech or audio (e.g., music). Here, we are interesting in voice disorder classification. That is, to develop two-class classifiers, which can discriminate between utterances of a subject suffering from say vocal fold paralysis and utterances of a healthy subject.The mathematical modeling of the speech production system in humans suggests that an all-pole system function is justified [1-3]. As a consequence, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs) constitute a first choice for modeling the magnitute of the short-term spectrum of speech. LPC-derived cepstral coefficients are guaranteed to discriminate between the system (e.g., vocal tract) contribution and that of the excitation. Taking into account the characteristics of the human ear, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) emerged as descriptive features of the speech spectral envelope. Similarly to MFCCs, the perceptual linear prediction coefficients (PLPs) could also be derived. The aforementioned sort of speaking tradi- tional features will be tested against agnostic-features extracted by convolu- tive neural networks (CNNs) (e.g., auto-encoders) [4]. The pattern recognition step will be based on Gaussian Mixture Model based classifiers,K-nearest neighbor classifiers, Bayes classifiers, as well as Deep Neural Networks. The Massachussets Eye and Ear Infirmary Dataset (MEEI-Dataset) [5] will be exploited. At the application level, a library for feature extraction and classification in Python will be developed. Credible publicly available resources will be 1used toward achieving our goal, such as KALDI. Comparisons will be made against [6-8].",https://github.com/gionanide/Speech_Signal_Processing_and_Classification,Python,2018-03-16 10:31:49,2024-09-19 15:19:01,238,63,3,MIT License

6750,natural-language-processing,Resume-Job-Description-Matching,binoydutt,The purpose of this project was to defeat the current Application Tracking System used by most of the organization to filter out resumes. In order to achieve this goal I had to come up with a universal score which can help the applicant understand the current status of the match.  The following steps were undertaken for this project 1) Job Descriptions were collected from Glass Door Web Site using Selenium as other scrappers failed 2) PDF resume parsing using PDF Miner 3) Creating a vector representation of each Job Description - Used word2Vec to create the vector in 300-dimensional vector space with each document represented as a list of word vectors 4) Given each word its required weights to counter few Job Description specific words to be dealt with - Used TFIDF score to get the word weights. 5) Important skill related words were given higher weights and overall mean of each Job description was obtained using the product for word vector and its TFIDF scores 6) Cosine Similarity was used get the similarities of the Job Description and the Resume 7) Various Natural Language Processing Techniques were identified to suggest on the improvements in the resume that could help increase the match score,https://github.com/binoydutt/Resume-Job-Description-Matching,Python,2018-05-28 06:17:09,2024-10-03 19:39:08,163,84,3,No License

An Attendance monitoring system is an essential part to maintain a quick and accurate record of the user’s attendance and provides timely summaries and records when it’s needed. Using an Attendance monitoring system in our firm eliminates the need for manual attendance which is a long and cumbersome process. This system is faster and more accurate than a manual attendance system, avoids incorrect data entry, duplication and helps reduce mundane paperwork. An Attendance monitoring system always requires a physical server but for the first time we are going for virtual server. The proposed RFID based attendance system uses physical hardware for capturing the student data and sends it to the Amazon Web Service (A.W.S) a Cloud Computing platform thus sends the email attachment containing student data on a scheduled time (5 P.M) from Monday to Friday.

Traditionally, these records are mostly stored either as documents or as unofficial copies on centralized servers.

This is because, to obtain an official copy, students are required to place an application with the academic department, and the whole process usually takes about 10 days. The delay is primarily caused because the records are validated at the source, which usually follows a convoluted process. The challenge is to offer a platform upon which all of a student’s credentials can be verified readily without actually approaching the source. This expedites the time to obtain the official records.",https://github.com/aditya30394/Decentralized-Howdy,JavaScript,2019-06-20 04:53:48,2024-03-11 16:12:50,2,0,0,MIT License

Examine the output from running PageRank on Simple English Wikipedia to measure the relative importance of pages in the corpus.

The attrition rate is typically calculated as the number of employees lost every year over the employee base. This employee base can be tricky however. Most firms just use a start of year employee count as the base. Some firms calculate it on a rolling 12 month basis to get a full year impact. This ratio becomes harder to use if your firm is growing its employee base. For example, let's say on Jan 1st of this year there were 1000 employees in the firm. Over the next 12 months we've lost 100 employees. Is it as straight forward as a 10% attrition rate. Where it gets fuzzy is how many of those 100 employees that were lost were in the seat on Jan 1st. Were all the 100 existing employees as of Jan 1st or were they new hires during the year that termed. Hence the attrition rate must be looked at in several views.",https://github.com/shishir349/Attrition-Analysis-on-the-HR-Department,Python,2020-05-25 13:35:48,2022-09-09 06:46:21,5,4,0,GNU General Public License v3.0

9874,data-analytics,Predicting-price-of-pre-owned-cars-,Nitishmaini,"The case study is on predicting the price of pre-owned cars. So, the problem statement is a Storm Motors is an e-commerce company, then they act as mediators between parties interested in selling and buying pre-owned cars and they have  a lots of data based on sales that have happened through them or otherwise and what the interest is in is to make a sale quickly. So, if the price is appropriate and that is something that you can satisfy both the seller and the buyer, then you will have your cars moving fast. So, what Storm Motors wants to do is they want to develop an algorithm, so that they can predict the price of the cars based on various attributes associated with the car. So, you might think of using a such a model from a Storm Motors viewpoint in multiple ways. If if a seller is asking for a price you could put the attributes of the car that the seller is selling into this model and then come up with a predicted price, and if it is much above what it is predicting then you can tell the seller that you know you are you are asking for too much and you are not likely to sell this car at this price. And, similarly a buyer comes and bids for a car at a much lesser price than what has been put up, then you could show the results of the model and tell the buyer, look you are asking for a very cheap price so, the seller is unlikely to give you this car at this price. So, if you got this right then you could optimize this transaction and then have a both the parties being happy and then you have a better business.",https://github.com/Nitishmaini/Predicting-price-of-pre-owned-cars-,Python,2020-05-21 05:33:07,2020-08-19 17:58:23,1,0,0,No License
