## Project Overview

The **GitHub Data Dive** application focuses on trending areas like machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and more. It extracts data using the GitHub API and provides a streamlined way to analyze trends in programming languages, repository activity, and more.

### How It Works
- **Data Extraction**: The app uses the GitHub API to fetch detailed information about repositories based on trending topics. It gathers metrics like repository names, programming languages, stars, forks, and other relevant information.
- **Data Cleaning and Storage**: Extracted data is cleaned and stored in a SQL database, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Built using Streamlit, the app provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing data. Users can explore the data using filters to see trends and other key metrics.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Extraction**: Get the latest data on trending repositories.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs that help users make data-driven decisions.
- **Filtering Options**: Narrow down repository searches by language, stars, forks, and other metrics.
- **Data Storage**: Cleaned and organized data stored in a SQL database for efficient access.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Requests
- **API**: GitHub API
- **Database**: SQL for data storage
- **Deployment**: Render for hosting the web app


## Use Cases
- **Developers**: Identify popular projects to contribute to or learn from.
- **Organizations**: Analyze open-source technology trends and repository activities.
